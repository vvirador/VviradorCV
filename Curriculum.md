> My name is Victoria Virador. I have a degree in Chemistry and a PhD in biology. I have been a Senior Scientist at NIH for a number of years where I taught, trained and mentored many young students. I have taught and mentored High School students, undergraduate students, graduate students and medical fellows the techniques used in basic and clinical research: their scientific basis, the appropriate protocols and the questions that can be answered with this research. My students have all gone to either Medical or Graduate Schools and are successful professionals. I have been an AP Biology and Chemistry tutor in the past two years and I taught High School Chemistry while attending College. I am bilingual in Spanish and English. I can tutor science courses, study skills and I can help your student prepare SAT and College Applications. Please call 301 897 2775 or email vvirador@gmail.com
